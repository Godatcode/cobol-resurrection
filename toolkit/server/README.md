# Server Wrapper

This directory contains Express.js server wrapper utilities.

## Planned Components

- `express-wrapper.js` - Pre-configured Express server with CORS and error handling
- `route-generator.js` - Automatic API route generation for legacy binaries
- `middleware.js` - Common middleware for validation and logging

These components enable rapid deployment of bridge servers for legacy systems.
