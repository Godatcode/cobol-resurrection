PLACEHOLDER SOUND FILES

The .mp3 files in this directory are SILENT PLACEHOLDERS.

For authentic vintage computing experience, replace these with:
- Real IBM mainframe recordings
- Teletype machine sounds
- Tape drive motor sounds
- Card reader mechanical sounds
- Console bell and buzzer sounds

See README.md for sourcing instructions.

These placeholders prevent console errors during development.
